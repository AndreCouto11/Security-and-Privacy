# Security-and-Privacy
This project, developed in a group of two, aimed to study how privacy-preserving techniques can be effectively utilized in data processing scenarios. Our primary goal was to explore and apply these techniques in solving concrete problems, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected throughout the process. Additionally, we analyzed and compared the advantages and disadvantages of the implemented solutions, assessing their effectiveness in balancing data privacy with functionality. This project was carried out as part of a Master's degree in Engineering and Data Science.
